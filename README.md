# Getting-and-cleaning-data---Assignment
The script run_analysis.R is an R script created to get and clean data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. It also summarizes the output as described in step 6 of the document.

The main steps are (see comments in the R script for more details):

1. Download the data.
2. Extract the different data tables and merge them.
3. Select and extract the relevant variables (mean and standard deviation for each measurement).
4. Make the variable names and content descriptive and readable.
5. Deliver the main tidy data set.
6. Create a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
